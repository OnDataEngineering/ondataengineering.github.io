There’s pros and cons all over the stack if you’re comparing it against the other distributions, but we’ll take a deeper look at this in a couple of weeks time.<p>There’s not much to say about <a href="/technologies/llama">Llama</a> - it was a piece of technology created by Cloudera to allow Impala to play nicely with YARN, but it’s not be adopted outside of Cloudera, who have themselves now deprecated it and will no longer be including it in CDH from v6.0 onwards (this wasn’t originally referenced in the technology summary so I’ve since updated it).<p><a href="/technologies/apache-whirr">Apache Whirr</a> feels like a bit of history. It’s well and truly dead now (with no development since September 2012, and having been moved into the Apache Attic in March 2015), however it was the first technology (I think I’m right in saying this) that allowed you to deploy Hadoop (and a whole pile of other technologies) into a cloud environment. It feels a little clunky and anachronistic now - there’s bespoke Java code written for each technology it supported to manage the software deployment and management using jclouds - but I’m guessing at the time it was almost revolutionary, paving the way for a whole pile of later technologies.<p>And on to <a href="/technologies/apache-impala">Apache Impala</a>. At some point I want to dig into the whole Impala/Hive debate / religious war (because it’s a fascinating look into the relationship and cultural differences between Cloudera and Hortonworks as much as anything). Hive has always been a large batch data transformation engine (albeit executing SQL) - every query starting a new job (originally MapReduce but lately Spark or Tez) with all the associated overheads and latency, but with the ability to process as much data as your Hadoop cluster would hold. What it wouldn’t do is support large numbers of more targeted queries at a low latency, for example from a group of users running queries against a data mart (the so called interactive query use case) - this was the use case Impala (and Parquet - the columnar data format) were created to target. Impala was therefore never designed to replace or compete with Hive, it’s competition are the traditional OLAP database such as Greenplum, Netezza and Teradata, with Impala trying to deliver a roughly comparable capability at a much lower cost. Hortonworks of course felt that Hive should support both use cases, and its introduction of LLAP (which allows long running processes to execute multiple queries) was it’s answer to this.<p>And that’s us for this week - have a good weekend, and we’ll see you on the other side. </span><div class="row t30"><div class="small-5 columns text-left"> <a class="button tiny radius prev" href="http://ondataengineering.net/blog/2017/03/31/the-week-that-was/"><span class="icon-chevron-left"></span>Next</a></div><div class="small-2 columns text-center"> <a class="button tiny radius" href="http://ondataengineering.net/blog/archive/" title="Archive">Archive</a></div><div class="small-5 columns text-right"> <a class="button tiny radius next" href="http://ondataengineering.net/blog/2017/03/20/hortonworks-to-cloudera/">Previous<span class="icon-chevron-right"></span></a></div></div></article><div class="row b30"></div></div><div class="medium-3 columns medium-pull-9"><aside><div class="panel sidebar radius"><p>OnDataEngineering is a collaboratively authored site on the transformation and preparation of data for analytics, licensed under a Creative Commons Licence.
