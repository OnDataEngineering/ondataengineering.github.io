Should be distributed and horizontally scaleable, support pre-defined and on-demand schemas, all standard search functionality plus analytics based on search including basic join functionality, aggregations, graph analytics and machine learning.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/compute-cluster-managers/">Compute Cluster Managers</a><td>Technologies that start and manage the executor processes for distributed and transient data processing jobs, and then manage the use of resources (primarily cpu and memory) across the jobs running on the cluster. Should provide a way of packaging jobs and ensuring jobs are isolated from each other during execution, for example to allow different jobs to run in different environments against different versions of libraries. When running over a combined compute / storage cluster (like Hadoop), should also support data locaility ensuring that individual executors are running next to the data they require.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/data-storage-formats/">Data Storage Formats</a><td>Libraries that support the storage of data on disk for data storage, real-time or batch analytics. Popularised by the use of distributed file systems in analytical platforms, common features include support for schema evolution (the ability to make changes to the schema but stil read all historical data), support for both row and columnar data layouts (supporting efficient batch processing and analytical workloads respectively), complex record formats including nested objects and arrays, indexing to support random data access, and support for efficient inserts, updates and deletes as well as ACID transactions.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/data-virtualization/">Data Virtualization</a><td>Tools that enable the execution of data queries across multiple data sources. Most support the ability to create a semantic layer or virtual data schema across the underlying data sources (including the caching or materialization of tables within this layer and the ability to update it and therefore the underlying data sources) alongside the ability to run arbitary queries across the underlying data (including in some cases the ability to do this without first defining the schema of the data in these sources). Query logic is pushed down where possible so that it's executed in the underlying data source, with joins and aggregation of data from multiple sources then performed within the data virtualisation layer. Sometimes refered to as data federation.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/graph-analytics/">Graph Analytics</a><td>Technologies that support analytics over graph data, either as a processing platform over data stored elsewhere, or as an analytical database. Unlike graph databases which work on individual records or small portions of the graph, graph analytics technologies specialise in running analytics that run over the entire graph database to generate aggregated results, identify data of interest, or to enrich the graph. Processing is often bsaed on a BSP (Bulk Synchronous Processing) model made famous by Pregel, the model created by Google to run their PageRank algorithm.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/graph-databases/">Graph Databases</a><td>Operational (OLTP) databases designed to support labelled property graph data models, where nodes and relationships have labels (types) and lists of property name-value pairs. Focus is on transactional ACID inserts/updates and traversal queries using index free adjacency (allows direct navigation between nodes without the use of indexes) over subsets of data rather than batch analytics over all data. Populate query interfaces/languages include Cypher (originated with Neo4J but now open source) and TinkerPop Gremlin (part of the TinkerPop framework that provides query capabilities and graph analytics over graph data).<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/hadoop-compatible-filesystems/">Hadoop Compatible Filesystems</a><td>A parallel distributed filesystem that implements the Hadoop FileSystem API and conforms to the Hadoop Compatible Filesystem specification, allowing it to be used in place of HDFS. The use of the FileSystem API (over native filesystem access) allows for parallel reads and location aware block placement, with the HCFS specification covering runtime behaviour. Note that Hadoop Compatible Filesystems (as per HDFS) are not fully POSIX compliant, there is no formal compatibility test suite (although a test suite that will highlight potential issues is available), and that some implementations (for example object stores) do not (and cannot) fully conform to the specification.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/hadoop-distributions/">Hadoop Distributions</a><td>Products or services built around Hadoop (or an Hadoop compatible core) combined with a number of Hadoop compatible products. Hadoop compatibility covers the use of YARN (for resource management of multiple jobs running on the same infrastructure) and HDFS (for local storage of data with support for co-locating processing with the data).<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/hadoop-distributions/distribution-comparison/">Hadoop Distributions Comparison</a><td>A comparison of different Hadoop distributions, focusing on the different software packages available in each to enable an understanding of whether a distribution contains the appropriate software to meet a requirement or business case.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/hadoop-distributions/ecosystem/">Hadoop Ecosystem</a><td>A view of the ecosystem around HDFS and YARN - the two major Hadoop components. Note that many technologies are not exclusive, and may run over other cluster filesystems or over other cluster management frameworks. Some technologies may be excluded for brevity and clarity.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/in-memory-databases/">In Memory Databases</a><td>Technologies that serve data entirely or primarily from memory, with the aim of providing significant higher performance for querying and accessing data. They are generally backed by some sort of persistent storage with guarentees around durability, with some technologies able to act as in memory caches over equivalent disk based technologies. The technologies listed on this page span a number of different technology categories, including relational databases, Hadoop compatible filesystems and key value stores, and will also appear under the relevent technology category page where they exist.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/nosql-wide-column-stores/">NoSQL Wide Column Stores</a><td>NoSQL databases based on Google Bigtable, the design of which was published in a paper in 2006. Often described as a sparse, distributed multi-dimensional sorted map (or key value store) - cells being referenced by a row and column key plus a timestamp or version (with columns arranged into column families), support for the names and formats of columns varying from row to row (within fixed column families), and architectures supporting massive horizontal scalability. Also called extensible record stores, and occasionally NoSQL column stores (although this definition is slightly inaccurate and confuses these technologies with more general purpose database columnar storage). Common functionality includes low latency high throughput reads and writes, scan/iterate operations, atomic mutations and cell level security. Common analytical use cases include the storage and serving of aggregations and metrics for real time dashboards, often as part of a wider ecosystem.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/object-stores/">Object Stores</a><td>Storage solutions whereby data is stored without any concept of folders or organisational structure, instead being referenced by a unique identifier, allowing for massively parallel and scalable solutions. Generally access via a REST API, with Amazon S3 the defacto standard, although many also support a range of file based interfaces as well, simulating a file system using the underlying object storage. Common features include support for multiple storage tiers, storage of custom metadata against data, replication of data for redundancy, and object versioning.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/query-engines/">Query Engines</a><td>Engines that allow queries expressed in a high level language (often SQL) to be run over one or more underlying data stores or databases, often including HDFS (and often using table definitions from the Hive Metastore), but with support for other Hadoop, relational and NoSQL databases commonly supported. Many technologies started as batch query engines (with high query startup costs and limited support for concurrent queries), but most can now be considered interactive with support for multiple concurrent low latency queries.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/rdf-databases/">RDF Databases</a><td>Databases designed to support the storage of RDF (or triple) data. RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a W3C data model standard that describes data as subject–predicate–object expressions (or triples). This allows the creation of graphs of knowledge, however unlike more general purpose graph databases, there is no support for properties or labels - everything is represented using triples. Data is queried using the SPARQL query language (another W3C standard). Internally, data can be considered to be stored as a single table containing three columns (the subject, predicate and object), with indexing to support the traversal and enumeration of predicates (relationsips) for a given subject. A number of triple ontologies (or schemas) are also available that define standard subject/object and predicate types allowing for data interchange, including OWL and RDFS. The W3C standards were introduced to support semantic web and Linked Open Data use cases that focus on semantics and inference.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/streaming-data-stores/">Streaming Data Stores</a><td>Technologies for the persistent storage of continuous streams of data, with data access based on a publish/subscribe model. Should support multiple independant publishers and subscribers, the ability to add new subscribers and replay the history of a stream, horizontal scalability and load balancing, durable writes, ordered streams (data is always read in the order it was written), high throughput and low latency characteristics, handling of updates and deletes to source records, and the ability to secure the data.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/tech-categories/time-series-databases/">Time Series Databases</a><td>Databases optimised for storing very large numbers of metrics and allowing these to be aggregated and analysed. Metrics are usually organised by measurements or metric names and one or more tags (e.g. to represent a server or instance). Many implement their own data storage layers, however many also run over external databases, typically NoSQL wide data stores. Use cases traditionally focus on monitoring infrastructure and applications or more recently IoT use cases, but analytics over any timestamped data is fair game.</table></span></article><div class="row b30"></div></div><div class="medium-3 columns medium-pull-9"><aside><div class="panel sidebar radius"><p>OnDataEngineering is a collaboratively authored site on the transformation and preparation of data for analytics, licensed under a Creative Commons Licence.
