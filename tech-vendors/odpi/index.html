Requires the use of Hadoop 2.7, Java 7 or 8, a standard set of environment variables, no modification of the public API and any addition features functions to be committed to the ASF. Uses Apache Bigtop as a reference implementation, with Bigtop also providing the certification test suite.<li>The <a href="https://github.com/odpi/specs/blob/master/ODPi-Operations.md">Operations Specification</a>, which provides the same for managing and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters with Ambari as reference implementation, including a contrib management pack that allows any product based on Ambari to deploy the ODPi reference implementation.</ul><h2 id="release-history">Release History</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>version<td>release date<td>release links<td>release comment<tr><td>1.0<td>March 2016<td> <td>MVP for ODPi runtime spec, validation test suite and reference implementation covering HDFS, YARN and MapReduce<tr><td>2.0<td>November 2016<td><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/14/odpi_20/">viewpoint from TheRegister</a><td>Added Operations Specification, and support for HCFS and Hive to the Runtime Specification<tr><td>2.1<td>April 2017<td><a href="https://www.odpi.org/blog/2017/04/05/odpi-2-1-a-tick-for-the-future-tock">summary</a><td>Moved to using Apache Bigtop for validation testsuite and reference implementation - ODPi release now only includes specifications</table><h2 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h2><ul><li><a href="http://vision.cloudera.com/the-open-data-platform-alliance/">Cloudera’s statement</a> was that there was no demand for a compliance standard from any of their partners, that the organisation was a pay-to-join vendor driven consortium that was contrary to the open source nature of Hadoop, and that open source trumps vendor driven standardisation with reference to Linux’s success and the subsequent Linux ecosystem over the attend to standardise *NIX distributions.<li><a href="https://mapr.com/blog/our-view-open-data-platform/">MapR’s statement</a> largely echoed Cloudera’s with the primary argument being that there wasn’t a requirement, citing a Gartner survey in which less than 1% of companies thought vendor lock in was an issue, and that there was a significant lack of breadth in the compliance technologies<li>TheRegister has a good summary of Cloudera and MapR’s positions <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/24/mapr_odp_cloudera/">here</a><li>A <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/14/odpi_20/">subsequent article from TheRegister</a> to coincide with the release of ODPi 2.0 includes an interview with Charaka Goonatilake, the CTO of Panaseer, that covers their two main issues as a software vendor, specifically that it doesn’t cover enough technologies or go deep enough, meaning it doesn’t actually help them test their product once and have confidence it’s going to work across all Hadoop distributions.<li>ZDNet have also a <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/odpi-runtime-spec-aims-to-defrag-hadoop/">useful write-up</a> of the challenges ODPi is experiencing</ul><h2 id="links">Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.odpi.org/">https://www.odpi.org/</a> - ODPi homepage<li><a href="https://github.com/odpi">https://github.com/odpi</a> - ODPi repository<li><a href="https://github.com/odpi/specs/wiki">https://github.com/odpi/specs/wiki</a> - ODPi specifications Wiki<li><a href="https://pivotal.io/big-data/press-release/technology-leaders-unite-around-open-data-platform-to-increase-enterprise-adoption-of-hadoop-and-big-data">Pivotal launch press release</a>, including links to the press releases from Altiscale, SAS and Verizon<li><a href="https://content.pivotal.io/blog/open-data-platform-initiative-putting-an-end-to-faux-pen-source-apache-hadoop-distributions">Summary of the original ODP plans</a> from Roman Shaposhnik</ul><h2 id="news">News</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.odpi.org/blog">https://www.odpi.org/blog</a> - ODPi blog<li>ODPi also have a subscription newsletter</ul><h2>Blog Posts</h2><ul class="side-nav"><li> <a href="https://ondataengineering.net/blog/2017/05/19/hadoop-wrap-up/"> <span class="font-size-h5 pr20">Hadoop Wrap-Up</span> <span id="page-meta" class="font-size-small"> <span class="pr10 icon-calendar"> 2017-05-19</span> <span class="pr10 icon-archive"> Tech Categories</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> ODPi</span> <span class="pr10 icon-edit"> Peter</span> </span> </a><li></ul></span></article><div class="row b30"></div></div><div class="medium-3 columns medium-pull-9"><aside><div class="panel sidebar radius"><p>OnDataEngineering is a collaboratively authored site on the transformation and preparation of data for analytics, licensed under a Creative Commons Licence.
