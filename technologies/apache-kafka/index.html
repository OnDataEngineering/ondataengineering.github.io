Part of the core Apache Kafka open source technology, connectors are available for a wide range of systems, including Hadoop, relational, NoSQL and analytical databases, search technologies and message queues amongst others. Runs separately to Kafka, in either a stand-alone or distributed cluster mode, with a REST API for managing connectors.<tr><td> Apache Kafka&nbsp;>&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/apache-kafka/kafka-streams/">Kafka Streams</a><td>Technology that allows stream processing to be added to a Kafka cluster, consuming and publishing events from and to Kafka topics (and potentially writing output to external systems). Based on an event-at-a-time model (i.e. not micro batch), with support for stateful processing, windowing, joining and re-processing data. Supports a low level DSL API, as well as a high level API that provides both stream and table abstractions (where tables present the latest record for each key).
