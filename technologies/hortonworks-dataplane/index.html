Supports a query editor (with autocomplete, a visual explain plan, performance improvement recommendations, saved queries and results downloading), a query search tool (with pre-defined queries for expensive, long running, non-optimised and failed queries, a range of filters and saved searches), a database management tool (supporting searching, browsing, interrogation, creation and modification of databases, tables, partitions and columns as well as uploading of data from local storage or HDFS) and table impact reporting (showing reads, writes, projections, aggregations, filters and joins by table and column, with support for dynamic heatmaps overlaid on entity relationship diagrams). Requires a Ambari mangement pack (the DAS engine) to be installed on all clusters.<tr><td> Hortonworks DataPlane&nbsp;>&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/hortonworks-dataplane/data-lifecycle-manager/">Data Lifecycle Manager</a><td>A DataPlane application for replicating HDFS and Hive data between two clusters along with any associated metadata and security policies. Clusters already registered with DataPlane can be paired, at which point replication policies can be defined, which result in replication jobs running at the selected interval. Supports replicating between HDFS and cloud object storage (with some caveats around replication of security policies), replication of encrypted HDFS data, TLS encryption of replication streams, reporting on and management of replication jobs and HDFS snapshottable directories, with jobs executed by DLM Engine processes on the appropriate cluster. Stated future plans include support for automatic tiering of data between clusters and point in time backup and restore.<tr><td> Hortonworks DataPlane&nbsp;>&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/hortonworks-dataplane/data-steward-studio/">Data Steward Studio</a><td>A DataPlane application for viewing and understanding data assets, with supported data assets currently limited to Hive tables on clusters with Atlas and Ranger installed. Supports viewing metadata associated with data assets (including properties, lineage, security policies and audit logs), profiling of data (with profiling performed by a background Spark process, with support for data summarisation, identifying sensitive/personal data and profiling user access to data), grouping of data assets into asset collections, taging and rating of data assets and collections and dashboard views of metadata by cluster and collection.<tr><td> Hortonworks DataPlane&nbsp;>&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/hortonworks-dataplane/streams-messaging-manager/">Streams Messaging Manager</a><td>A DataPlane application for monitoring Apache Kafka clusters. Provides an overview view of producers, topics (and their partitions), brokers and consumer groups, showing key statistics and the connections between them, with the ability to propagate filters based on these connections. Also provides detail views, profiles and historic graphs for each producer, topic, broker and consumer group, with the ability to link out to Atlas to see end to end lineage and Ambari Grafana for detailed metrics. Metrics and status information is also provided over a REST API, with a REST Server Agent running on each cluster being monitored.</table><h2 id="release-history">Release History</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>version<td>release date<td>release links<td>release comment<tr><td>1.0<td>2017-11-01<td><a href="https://hortonworks.com/blog/hdp-2-6-3-dataplane-service/">announcement</a><td> <tr><td>1.1<td>2018-05-21<td><a href="https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/DP/DP-1.1.0/release-notes/content/dps_whats_new_in_this_release.html">release notes</a><td>Significantly expanded docs<tr><td>1.2<td>2018-08-25<td><a href="https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/DP/DP-1.2.0/release-notes/content/dps_whats_new_in_this_release.html">release notes</a><td>Support for HDP 3.0 and HDF 3.2</table><h2 id="links">Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://hortonworks.com/products/dataplane/">https://hortonworks.com/products/dataplane/</a> - homepage<li><a href="https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/DP/DP-1.2.0/index.html">https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/DP/DP-1.2.0/index.html</a> - documentation<li><a href="https://hortonworks.com/blog/category-emerges-introducing-hortonworks-dataplane-service/">https://hortonworks.com/blog/category-emerges-introducing-hortonworks-dataplane-service/</a> - intro blog post<li><a href="https://github.com/hortonworks/dps_platform">https://github.com/hortonworks/dps_platform</a> - source code</ul><h2 id="news">News</h2><ul><li><a href="http://docs.hortonworks.com/index.html">http://docs.hortonworks.com/index.html</a> - shows latest Hortonworks release version<li><a href="https://hortonworks.com/blog/">https://hortonworks.com/blog/</a> - Hortonworks blog posts</ul><h2>Blog Posts</h2><ul class="side-nav"><li> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/blog/2018/09/28/thoughts-on-hortonworks-dataplane/"> <span class="font-size-h5 pr20">Thoughts on Hortonworks DataPlane</span> <span id="page-meta" class="font-size-small"> <span class="pr10 icon-calendar"> 2018-09-28</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> Hortonworks DataPlane</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> Cloudera SDX</span> <span class="pr10 icon-edit"> Peter</span> </span> </a><li> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/blog/2017/11/03/thoughts-on-hortonworks-dataplane-and-cloudera-sdx/"> <span class="font-size-h5 pr20">Thoughts on Hortonworks DataPlane and Cloudera SDX</span> <span id="page-meta" class="font-size-small"> <span class="pr10 icon-calendar"> 2017-11-03</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> Hortonworks</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> Hortonworks DataPlane Service</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> Cloudera</span> <span class="pr10 icon-edit"> Peter</span> </span> </a><li></ul></span></article><div class="row b30"></div></div><div class="medium-3 columns medium-pull-9"><aside><div class="panel sidebar radius"><p>OnDataEngineering is a collaboratively authored site on the transformation and preparation of data for analytics, licensed under a Creative Commons Licence.
