Originally released by Cloudera as Cloudera Desktop in October 2009, before being open sourced as Hue in June 2010. Python/Django based, under active development with a wide range of contributors, and available for all major Hadoop distributions.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/kite/">Kite</a><td>A set of libraries, tools, examples, and documentation focused on making it easier to build systems on top of the Hadoop ecosystem. Consists of three sub-projects - Kite Data (a logical dataset abstraction over Hadoop), Morphlines (embeddable configuration driven transformation pipelines) and Kite Maven Plugin (a Maven plugin for deploying Hadoop applications). Java based, Open Source under the Apache 2.0 licence and hosted on GitHub. First released in May 2013 by Cloudera as the Cloudera Development Kit (CDK), renamed to Kite in December 2013, and reached a v1.0 release in February 2015 with a number of external contributors. Last release was v1.1 in June 2015, with very little development activity since this time.<tr><td> Kite&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/kite/kite-data/">Kite Data</a><td>Library that provides a logical dataset and record abstraction over HDFS, S3, local filesystems and HBase, including support for partitioning and views (which allow datasets to be filtered and supports automatic partition pruning). Provides a command line interface and Maven plugin for managing and viewing datasets. Supports Crunch, Flume, Spark and MapReduce, and can integrate with a Hive Metastore to make datasets available through Hive and Impala. Stores data using Avro (utilising Avro schema evolution / resolution) or Parquet.<tr><td> Kite&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/kite/kite-maven-plugin/">Kite Maven Plugin</a><td>A Maven plugin that supports the packaging, deployment and execution of applications onto Hadoop.<tr><td> Kite&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/kite/morphlines/">Morphlines</a><td>A configuration driven in-memory transformation pipeline that can be embedded into any Java code base, with specific support for Flume, MapReduce, HBase, Spark and Solr. Supports multiple different file types including CSV, Avro, JSON, Parquet, RCFile, SequenceFile, ProtoBuf and XML plus gzip, bzip2, tar zip and jar files. Also supports a number of transformation steps out of the box, including integration with Apache Tika for reading common file formats.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/livy/">Livy</a><td>A service that allows Spark jobs (pre-compiled JARs) or code snippets (Scala or Python) to be executed by remote systems over a REST API or via clients for Java, Scala and Python. Supports re-use of Spark Contexts (and caching and sharing of RDDs across jobs and clients), multiple concurrent clients, secure authenticated communications and batch job submissions. Started in November 2015 based on code from Hue, with a formal announcement and first release in June 2016. Open source under the Apache 2.0 licence, hosted on GitHub with development led by Cloudera and Microsoft. Still considered to be in alpha, but under active development, and used by tools such as Hue and Zeppelin.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/llama/">Llama</a><td>Framework for long running low-latency distributed applications to request resources from YARN, built to support Apache Impala. Operates as an un-managed YARN application master (that handles resource requests over a Thrift API and delivers resource notifications) and a node manager plugin (that delivers resource availability information to co-located services). Created by Cloudera in August 2013 and hosted on GitHub under an Apache 2.0 licence. Maintained by Cloudera to support new Impala and CDH releases, but now deprecated and will no longer be included in CDH from v6.0 onwards.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/quantcast-file-system/">Quantcast File System</a><td>Open source HDFS compatible distributed file system, which focuses on improving performance and scalability over HDFS. Uses erase coding (specifically Reed-Solomon error correction) allowing each data block to be stored with a 50% overhead over 9 nodes with data able to be read from any 6 (half the space required by HDFS with 3 way replication). Also supports online addition of new data (chunk) nodes, automatic re-balancing and re-replication of data, Unix style permissions support and C++ and Java client libraries. Published benchmarks suggest a 50/75% read/write performance increase over HDFS, and significantly faster metadata operations. Now also runs over Amazon S3. Built and maintained by Quantcast, who open sourced it in August 2012. An evolution of the Kosmos File System (KFS), an open source project started by Kosmix in 2005, which Quantcast first adopted in 2007. Built in C++ and released under the Apache 2.0 licence.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/recordservice/">RecordService</a><td>Abstraction layer for accessing structured data in Hadoop that enforces fine grained access control (via Apache Sentry). Currently supports reading data from HDFS and S3 in Parquet, Text, Sequence File, RC and Avro format via a Hive table/view definition or a file path, with support for HBase and Kudu planned. Supports direct access to data via C++ and Java APIs, plus integration with MapReduce, Spark, Impala and Pig, with support for Hive planned. Supports the Apache Sentry security model, including table, view, file (via grants on uris to create external tables) and column level security, with row level filtering and data masking planned. Started in January 2015 and announced with an initial beta release in September 2015. Still in beta, with a stated plan for RecordService to be donated to the Apache Foundation in the future. Open sourced under Apache 2.0 licence, and implemented in C++ and Java.</table></span></article><div class="row b30"></div></div><div class="medium-3 columns medium-pull-9"><aside><div class="panel sidebar radius"><p>OnDataEngineering is a collaboratively authored site on the transformation and preparation of data for analytics, licensed under a Creative Commons Licence.
