Supports a wide range of sources, targets and buffers (channels), along with the ability to chain agents together and to modify and drop events in-flight. Designed to be highly reliable, and to support reconfiguration without the need for a restart. Heavily integrated with the Hadoop ecosystem. An Apache project, donated by Cloudera in June 2011, graduating in June 2012, with a v1.2 release (the first considered ready for production use) in July 2012. Java based, with commercial support available as part of most Hadoop distributions.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/apache-hadoop/">Apache Hadoop</a><td>A distributed storage and compute platform consisting of a distributed filesystem (HDFS) and a cluster workload and resource management layer (YARN), along with MapReduce, a solution built on HDFS and YARN for massive scale parallel processing of data. Has an extensive ecosystem of compatible technologies. An Apache Open Source project, started in January 2006 as a Lucene sub-project, becoming a top level project in January 2008, with a 1.0 release in December 2011 (containing HDFS and MapReduce), and a 2.2 release (the first 2.x GA release) in October 2013 (adding YARN). Very active, with a deep and broad range of contributors, and backing from multiple commercial vendors.<tr><td> Apache Hadoop&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/apache-hadoop/hdfs/">HDFS</a><td>A highly resilient distributed cluster file system proven at extreme scale that supports user authentication, extended ACLs, snapshots, quotas, central caching, a REST API, an NFS gateway, rolling upgrades, transparent encryption and heterogeneous storage. Part of the original Hadoop code base, becoming an Apache Hadoop sub-project in July 2009.<tr><td> Apache Hadoop&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/apache-hadoop/map-reduce/">MapReduce</a><td>A data transformation and aggregation technology proven at extreme scale that works on key value pairs and consists of three transformation stages - map (a general transformation of the input key value pairs), shuffle (brings all pairs with the same key together) and reduce (an aggregation of all pairs with the same key). Part of the original Hadoop code base, becoming an Apache Hadoop sub-project in July 2009.<tr><td> Apache Hadoop&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/apache-hadoop/yarn/">YARN</a><td>Resource management and job scheduling &amp; monitoring for the Hadoop ecosystem. Includes support for capacity guarantees amongst other scheduling options. Added as an Apache Hadoop sub-project as part of Hadoop 2.x (with a GA release as part of 2.2 in October 2013) having been started in January 2008.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/apache-hbase/">Apache HBase</a><td>NoSQL wide-column datastore based on Google BigTable. Focuses on random real-time access to data, and supports horizontal scalability, consistent reads and writes, versioning and fine grained security controls. Runs on Hadoop and HDFS, and is heavily integrated with the Hadoop ecosystem. An Apache project, first released as part of Hadoop 0.15 in October 2007 before graduating as a top level project in May 2010. Java based, with commercial support available as part of most Hadoop distributions.<tr><td> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/apache-hive/">Apache Hive</a><td>Technology that supports the exposure of data in Hadoop as structured tables and the execution of analytical SQL queries over these. Consists of a number of distinct components (that we treat as sub-projects) including Hive Metastore (stores the definitions of the structured tables), Hive Server (supports the execution of analytical SQL queries as MapReduce, Spark or Tez jobs) and HCatalog (allows MapReduce and Pig jobs to read and write Hive tables). First released by Facebook as an Hadoop contrib module in September 2008, becoming an Hadoop sub-project in November 2008, and a top level Apache project in September 2010, following a first official stable release (0.3) in April 2009. Java based, under active development from a number of large commercial sponsors, with commercial support available as part of most Hadoop distributions.<tr><td> Apache Hive&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/apache-hive/hcatalog/">HCatalog</a><td>Libraries for MapReduce and Pig to read and write data to and from Hive tables, albeit with some limitations. Also supports a CLI for querying and updating the Hive Metastore, however this doesn't support the full range of Hive DDL commands. Includes WebHCat, a REST API over the HCatalog CLI that also supports the execution of MapReduce, Pig, Hive and Sqoop jobs. Donated to the Apache foundation by Yahoo in March 2011, had WebHCat folded in in July 2012, graduating as a top level project in February 2013, but then almost immediately was folded into Hive in March 2013 as part of the Hive 0.11 release. Has seem limited development since this time.<tr><td> Apache Hive&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/apache-hive/hive-metastore/">Hive Metastore</a><td>A metadata service that allows structured tables to be defined over files in HDFS (and also HBase or Accumulo), providing an API that allows the metadata to be queried and updated by other tools including Impala, Spark SQL or RecordService. Supports partitioned and clustered tables, as well as complex field types such as arrays, maps and structs. Backed by a relational database (either MySQL, Postgres and Oracle). Part of the original Hive code base.<tr><td> Apache Hive&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/apache-hive/hive-server/">Hive Server</a><td>Supports the execution of SQL queries over data in HDFS based on tables defined in the Hive Metastore, as well as DDL to query and update the Hive Metastore. Focus is on analytical (OLAP) use cases, with some support for batch updates to data. Originally executed queries as MapReduce jobs, but significant investment from has seen support for executing queries as Spark and as Tez jobs, with work underway to support sub second query times using Tez. Recent changes have also seen it achieve significant SQL compliance, with support for SQL:2011 analytical functions on-going. Accepts queries over an API with JDBC and ODBC drivers available, and includes Beeline, a command line JDBC client. Technically referred to as Hive Server 2, and was introduced in Hive 0.11 as a replacement for the original Hive Server to address a number of concurrency and security issues.</table></span></article><div class="row b30"></div></div><div class="medium-3 columns medium-pull-9"><aside><div class="panel sidebar radius"><p>OnDataEngineering is a collaboratively authored site on the transformation and preparation of data for analytics, licensed under a Creative Commons Licence.
