Tables are stored as first class objects in MapR-FS volumes, and are sharded into table regions / tablets. JSON document tables are schemaless, support read and write access to individual document fields, subsets of fields or whole documents, finding documents by id or via a full table scan query, a set of atomic operations for mutating documents, and integration with MapReduce. Wide column (binary) tables are largely equivalent to HBase tables, and partially support the HBase API, but without support for custom HBase filters or co-processors. Supports replication at the table, column family or column level, either synchronously or asynchronously, and in either master-master or master-slave configurations, with support for replicating to Elasticsearch. Authentication is managed through access control expressions (ACEs) at the field level (for JSON document tables) or at the column level (for wide column tables). Introduced in MapR v4.0 in Sept 2014, with document supported added in MapR 5.1 in Feb 2016.<tr><td> MapR File System&nbsp;>&nbsp; <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/technologies/mapr-file-system/mapr-streams/">MapR-Streams</a><td>Extension to MapR-FS to provide streaming data storage capabilities and a Kafka compatible API. Messages (key/value pairs where the key is optional) are organised into topics, which are partitioned and stored as first class objects within MapR-FS volumes, with topics then grouped into streams. Supports encryption of streams, automatic deletion of messages (via a time to live), consumer groups, authorisation using ACEs (access control expressions), plus replication of topics to one or more remote MapR-Streams instances either synchronously or asynchronously, including support for Kafka's MirrorMaker. Comes with Java, C and Python libraries and includes a Kafka compatible API. Introduced in MapR 5.1 in Feb 2016.</table><h2>Related Technologies</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Is packaged by<td><a href="/technologies/mapr-converged-data-platform/">MapR Converged Data Platform</a></table><h2 id="links">Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://mapr.com/products/mapr-fs/">https://mapr.com/products/mapr-fs/</a> - product home page<li><a href="https://mapr.com/products/mapr-distribution-including-apache-hadoop/">https://mapr.com/products/mapr-distribution-including-apache-hadoop/</a> - links to whitepapers and further detail on key features<li><a href="http://maprdocs.mapr.com/home/MapROverview/c_overview_intro.html">http://maprdocs.mapr.com/home/MapROverview/c_overview_intro.html</a> - overview<li><a href="http://maprdocs.mapr.com/home/MapROverview/c_maprfs.html">http://maprdocs.mapr.com/home/MapROverview/c_maprfs.html</a> - documentation<li><a href="https://mapr.com/blog/mapr-fs-vs-hdfs-5-minute-guide-understanding-their-differences-whiteboard-walkthrough/">https://mapr.com/blog/mapr-fs-vs-hdfs-5-minute-guide-understanding-their-differences-whiteboard-walkthrough/</a> - comparison to HDFS</ul><h2 id="news">News</h2><ul><li>Updates via MapR release announcements and blog</ul><ul></ul><h2>Blog Posts</h2><ul class="side-nav"><li> <a href="http://ondataengineering.net/blog/2017/04/28/the-week-that-was/"> <span class="font-size-h5 pr20">The Week That Was - 28/04/2017</span> <span id="page-meta" class="font-size-small"> <span class="pr10 icon-calendar"> 2017-04-28</span> <span class="pr10 icon-archive"> Technologies</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> Myriad</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> MapR Monitoring</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> MapR Streams Clients and Tools</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> MapR-FS</span> <span class="pr10 icon-price-tag"> MapR-DB</span> <span class="pr10 icon-edit"> Peter</span> </span> </a><li></ul></span></article><div class="row b30"></div></div><div class="medium-3 columns medium-pull-9"><aside><div class="panel sidebar radius"><p>OnDataEngineering is a collaboratively authored site on the transformation and preparation of data for analytics, licensed under a Creative Commons Licence.
